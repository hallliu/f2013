\subsection*{1}
\ssn{a}
If we calculate $\tl{r}^\mi=\tl{Y}^\mi-X\h{\beta}^\mi$, each entry of the resulting vector will be the same as the corresponding entry of $r^\mi$ except for the $i$th, which will be zero because the $i$th entry of $\tl{Y}^\mi$ is $x_i^T\h{\beta}^\mi$. Now, note that since the true regression coefficient vector $\zeta^\mi$ satisfies $X^T(X\zeta^\mi-\tl{Y}^\mi)=0$, we want to show that $X^T\tl{r}^\mi=0$, for that would imply that $\h{\beta}^\mi=\zeta^\mi$ (this requires that $X$ be full-rank). 

To do this, note that $(X^\mi)^Tr^\mi=0$, so we have for each $j\in[1..p]$ that $\sum_{k\neq i}X_{kj}r_k=0$. However, since $\tl{r}^\mi_i=0$, adding in that term doesn't change the sum, so $\sum_{k\in[1..n]}X_{kj}\tl{r}^\mi_k=0$ as well, which shows that $X^T\tl{r}^\mi=0$.
\ssn{b}
The fitted value is just the data-to-be-fitted multiplied by the regression coefficient, which we know to be $\h{\beta}^\mi$, so the fit at $x_i$ is $x_i^T\h{\beta}^\mi$.
\subsection*{2}
This was essentially assigned as problem 5 on HW5.
\ssn{c}
Since the diagonals of the hat matrix are bounded between $0$ and $1$, the denominator on the RHS must also be. Thus, the LHS must be larger than the numerator on the RHS.

%Under backwards selection, set the critical $p$-value to $0.1$, and regress. On the first iteration, we remove the Gleason score with $p=0.775$. On the second iteration, we remove log of capuslar penetration (\verb|lcp|) with $p=0.251$. On the third iteration, we remove \verb|pgg45| with $p$-value $0.253$. On the fourth iteration, we remove age with $p=0.170$. On the fifth iteration, we remove \verb|lbph| with $p=0.112$, and finally we arrive at a model where all predictors significant at the $0.1$ level. During the entire process, the $R^2$ value increased by about $0.01$. The final output follows.

%The model with the $5$ predictors (\verb|gleason|, \verb|lcp|, and \verb|pgg45| removed) seems to do the best, with a $C_p$ score of $5.715$

Under backwards selection, set the critical $p$-value to $0.1$, and regress. On the first iteration, we remove \verb|status| with $p=0.854$. On the second iteration, we remove \verb|verbal| with $p=0.140$. Having removed these two, all predictors are now significant, and the final result of the model is as follows:

We can obtain a summary of which model is the best for a given size by calling \verb|b = regsubsets(gamble ~ ., data=teengamb)|, which gives us
\begin{verbatim}
         sex status income verbal
1  ( 1 ) " " " "    "*"    " "   
2  ( 1 ) "*" " "    "*"    " "   
3  ( 1 ) "*" " "    "*"    "*"   
4  ( 1 ) "*" "*"    "*"    "*" 
\end{verbatim}
To get the adjusted $R^2$ values out of this, we call \verb|summary(b)$adjr2|, which gives us that the model with $3$ parameters has the highest value, or the one excluding only \verb|status|.
\ssn{d}
Calling \verb|summary(b)$cp| and looking for which one best approximates $C_p=p$, we see that it's still the model with $3$ parameters.
\subsection*{4(8.5)}
Running all four variable selection procedures we did above on the stack loss data set tells us that we should remove only acid concentration, with a $p$-value of $0.344$. On the last homework, we found that case 21 was an outlier. If we remove this point, the result is still the same -- acid concentration should still be removed.
