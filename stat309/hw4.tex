\subsection*{1}
\ssn{a}
Suppose $U$ were singular. Then, its image would have dimension $<n$, which means that the image of $LU$ would have dimension $<n$. However, since $A$ is full rank, the image of $\Pi_1A\Pi_2$ must have dimension $n$, contradiction. We also know that $L_1$ is nonsingular because it is lower triangular and all of its diagonal entries are $1$s, giving it a determinant of $1$.
\ssn{b}
Starting with $\|Ax-b\|$, left-multiply by $\Pi_1$ to obtain $\|\Pi_1Ax-\tl{b}\|$. Note that since $LU=\Pi_1A\Pi_2$, we have $\Pi_1A=LU\Pi_2^T$, so the quantity to be minimized is then $\|LU\tl{x}-\tl{b}\|$. Let $y=U\tl{x}$. Then, we want to minimize $\|Ly-\tl{b}\|$, which we can do by solving the normal equation $L^TLy=L^Tb$. We can then find $\tl{x}$ by backsolving $y=U\tl{x}$ (where a unique solution is guaranteed because $U$ is invertible).

We can solve the normal equation quickly by backsolving twice: let $\tl{y}=Ly$, and backsolve $L^T\tl{y}=L^Tb$ for $\tl{y}$. Then backsolve $\tl{y}=Ly$ for $y$.
\subsection*{2}
\ssn{a}
If we form $A^TA$, we obtain $\openm3&3\\3&3+2\ep^2\closem$, which is really, really close to being singular if $\ep$ is small. In addition, $\ep^2$ may fall below machine precision (at least compared to the other entries), which would actually make the matrix singular.
\ssn{b}
Multiply them together, get $A$. $L$ and $U$ are easily recognized to be in the correct form.
\ssn{c}
The $L$ matrix found has no $\ep$ terms: none of its terms have small perturbations, and the columns are much further away from being linearly dependent than the columns of $A$. Thus, it's a better conditioned problem than solving the normal equation directly.
\ssn{d, e}
Since the rank of $A$ is 2, the $LU$ factorization above is a rank-retaining factorization. Thus, from the formula we have for pseudoinverse from a rank-retaining factorization, we have $A^+=U^T(UU^T)^{-1}(L^TL)^{-1}L^T$. Computing each of them, we have $UU^T=\openm2&\ep\\\ep&\ep^2\closem$, so its inverse is $\openm1&-\ep^{-1}\\-\ep^{-1}&2\ep^{-2}\closem$. $L^TL=\openm3&0\\0&2\closem$ so $(L^TL)^{-1}=\openm1/3&0\\0&1/2\closem$. Forming the big product, 
\begin{align*}
    A^+&=\openm1&0\\1&\ep\closem\openm1&-\ep^{-1}\\-\ep^{-1}&2\ep^{-2}\closem\openm1/3&0\\0&1/2\closem\openm1&1&1\\0&1&-1\closem\\
       &=\openm1&-\ep^{-1}\\0&\ep^{-1}\closem\openm1/3&0\\0&1/2\closem\openm1&1&1\\0&1&-1\closem\\
       &=\openm1/3&-\ep^{-1}/2\\0&\ep^{-1}/2\closem\openm1&1&1\\0&1&-1\closem\\
       &=\openm1/3&1/3-\ep^{-1}/2&1/3+\ep^{-1}/2\\0&\ep^{-1}/2&-\ep^{-1}/2\closem\\
\end{align*}
which gives us the expression desired after factoring out a $\frac{1}{6}$.
\ssn{3}
\ssn{a}
Using what we had in (1a), the least squares problem is equivalent to minimizing $\|LU\tl{x}-\tl{b}\|=\|Ly-\tl{b}\|$. If we write $L=\openm L_1\\L_2\closem$, then $Ly=\openm L_1y\\L_2y\closem=\openm z\\L_2L_1^{-1}z\closem=\openm I_n\\S\closem z$, so the original problem is then equivalent to
